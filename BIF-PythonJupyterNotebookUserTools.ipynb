    "To start using this notebook, you will need an Excel BIF file that you downloaded from either AmeriFlux or FLUXNET. In this example, the file is in my home directory and I started with the AmeriFlux all sites BIF. This code should be able to read any BIF. \n",

If you have updated a single segment of code in a notebook, select the cell you want to execute and choose \"Cell->Run Cells\". The first code cell in this notebook does all of the setup and must be run to completion before any of the other cells can be run. When it is done running, it will print 'DONE' below the code box.\n",

    "In several of the code segments there are mechanisms that you can use to customize the code to do something different than it currently does. For instance, you can have it look for a different VARIABLE_GROUP or limit down the list of sites by specifying a sites filter. You can also specify whether you want to print to a file in the printtofile variable in the cells that can print to a file. \n",

The 1050 ha forest extends across an elevational range from 200 to 900 m a.s.l. It was established in 1931 and is managed by the USDA Forest Service Northeastern Research Station in Durham, NH. The climate is humid continental with short, cool summers (mean July temperature, 19.8C) and long, cold winters (mean January temperature, 9.8C). Annual precipitation averages 130 cm and is distributed evenly throughout the year. Soils are developed from glacial till and are predominantly shallow, well-drained spodosols. At lowto mid-elevation, vegetation is dominated by northern hardwoods (American beech, Fagus grandifolia; sugar maple, Acer saccharum; yellow birch, Betula alleghaniensis; with some red maple, Acer rubrum and paper birch, Betula papyrifera). Conifers (eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis; eastern white pine, Pinus strobus; red spruce, Picea rubens) are occasionally found intermixed with the more abundant deciduous species but are generally confined to the highest (red spruce) and lowest (hemlock and pine) elevations. In 2003, the site was adopted as a NASA North American Carbon Program (NACP) Tier-2 field research and validation site. A 26.5 m high tower was installed in a low-elevation northern hardwood stand in November, 2003, for the purpose of making eddy covariance measurements of the forest–atmosphere exchange of CO2, H2O and radiant energy. Continuous flux and meteorological measurements began in January, 2004, and are ongoing. Average canopy height in the vicinity of the tower is approximately 20–22 m. In the tower footprint, the forest is predominantly classified into red maple, sugar maple, and American beech forest types. Leaf area index in the vicinity of the tower is 3.6 as measured by seasonal litterfall collection, and 4.5 as measured by the optically based Li-Cor LAI-2000 instrument.

(1) Trees were destructively harvested in the field during 2000-2002 with an LAI determined from allometric scaling measurements and producing an estimated value of 3.8-4.2 m2/m2 (total range in east-west flux footprint). (2) A photometric method as reported by Chen, J.M. (1995)  Agric. Forest Meteorol. 80: 135-163, was used in 2001 and provided an estimate for LAI of 5.0-5.6 m2/m2 (total range in east-west flux footprint).  (3) An independent allomtetric study was done in 2006 using different harvested trees from the earlier study.  This study resulted in an LAI estimate of 3.1-3.8 m2/m2 (total range in the east-west footprint).  Taking all studies together a good representative LAI for the site is 4.2 m2/m2.\", , \"Other\", , \"20000718\", , , , , , , , , , , , \n",
